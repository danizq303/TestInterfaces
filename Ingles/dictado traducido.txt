Dear Sirs, I have been able to ascertain from various sources that your company _.SA is a leader in the temporary employment sector and I am writing to you to inform you of my interest in joining your company as a sales representative.
Due to my experience as a representative in the same sector for a period of four years, I have followed with attention the development of your activities in the labour market, therefore I consider that I could be useful to you as a member of your staff.
I would like to have the opportunity to meet you personally in an interview to discuss my knowledge and experience in detail.
In the hope of receiving an affirmative answer, I send you my best regards Daniel Izquierdo.
PS I attach my curriculum vitae and recent photo.
